Greyboxer - a 2D to 3D shape drawer. 
-
Spamming walls/segmented, roofs and floors in Blender have never been faster!
Increment (can be turned off) based 2D outline drawer *on Z plane in Blender & Advanced* and a *RAW one in 2D Window* for Unity.

**Lacks:**
1. Merge by distance if you want to close walls in edge mode. (well, still faster than to use probuilder and its easy to do by Tab, Z to X-ray, select them, M - merge by distance)
2. Undo/redo functionality
3. Damn, can't redo the object, but can undo it, lol. (ah, it seems its yet another missed addon bug, but not fixed, the redo doesn't work at all on anything now, relaunching Blender..)

BRAND NEW V1.1 BLOOD AND PAIN EARNED!
